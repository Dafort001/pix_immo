Implement “Editor Job Page” (placeholder version, English only)

Goal

Implement a simple Editor Job Page that external photo editors can access via a tokenized link.
The page is:

fully in English (no German words in UI, labels or messages),

showing a placeholder editing briefing (dummy text),

providing one download button for the raw ZIP

and one upload section for the finished ZIP.

The detailed editing styles and rules will be added later. For now, we just need a working page with placeholder texts.

1. Route / URL

Create a new page reachable via:

Frontend route: /editor/job/:jobId

The page must be called with a t query parameter (token), e.g.:

/editor/job/ABC12?t=someLongTokenString

On initial load the frontend must call a backend API like:

GET /api/editor/jobs/:jobId?t=<token>

If the backend responds with an error (401/403/404):

Show a minimal error page in English:

Title:
Link not available

Text:
This link is not available or has expired. Please contact your client if you think this is a mistake.

No German on this page.

2. Backend response shape (assumption)

Assume the backend returns JSON like this on success:

{
  "jobId": "12345",
  "shootCode": "ABC12",
  "objectName": "Penthouse with river view",
  "city": "Hamburg",
  "deadlineDisplay": "25 Nov 2025, 18:00",
  "status": "NOT_UPLOADED", 
  "downloadUrl": "https://r2...signed.zip",
  "allowUpload": true,
  "placeholderNotes": "No final briefing available yet. Please follow the general guidelines."
}


You can adapt field names if our existing conventions require it, but the page needs at least these fields:

shootCode

objectName

city

deadlineDisplay (already formatted string is OK)

status (NOT_UPLOADED | UPLOADING | UPLOADED)

downloadUrl (signed URL to ZIP)

allowUpload (boolean)

placeholderNotes (string, text that we can fill later)

3. Layout / Content (all in English)
3.1 Header section

At the top of the page, show:

Line 1 (Title):
Job: {shootCode} – {objectName}

Line 2:
Location: {city}

Line 3:
Deadline: {deadlineDisplay}

Line 4 (short status text, depending on status):

NOT_UPLOADED → Status: No files uploaded yet

UPLOADING → Status: Upload in progress

UPLOADED → Status: Files uploaded

No German on the page.

3.2 Placeholder “Editing Briefing” section

Below the header, show a card/box titled:

Title:
Editing briefing (placeholder)

Content (fixed English text for now):

This job does not yet contain a finalized editing briefing.
Please follow the general guidelines below until a full briefing is provided.

• Keep colors natural and realistic.
• Avoid heavy saturation or artificial tones.
• Maintain straight vertical lines where possible.
• Keep the interior bright and clean.
• Do not rename any files.
• Return all edited images in a single ZIP file.

Additional notes:
{placeholderNotes}


Where {placeholderNotes} comes from the backend field placeholderNotes.
If placeholderNotes is empty, just show Additional notes: with an empty line below.

3.3 Download section

Below the briefing, add a Download section.

Title:
Download raw images

Text:

Click the button below to download the ZIP file containing all original images for this job.

Button:
Download ZIP

Clicking this button must open downloadUrl from the backend.
If downloadUrl is missing or empty, disable the button and show:

No download is currently available for this job.

3.4 Upload section

Under the download section, add an Upload area.

Title:
Upload finished images (ZIP only)

Text:

Please upload one ZIP file containing all edited images.
Do not upload individual files.
Do not rename any files before uploading.


If allowUpload is true:

Show:

a file input (drag & drop or simple button), restricted to .zip

an upload button: Upload ZIP

If allowUpload is false:

Do not show the file input.

Show this message instead:

Uploads are no longer allowed for this job. Please contact your client if you need to submit a correction.

All texts in English.

4. Upload flow & API calls

We need a simple two-step upload flow:

Request upload URL

When the editor selects a file and clicks Upload ZIP, call:

POST /api/editor/jobs/:jobId/upload-url?t=<token>

Backend returns JSON like:

{
  "uploadUrl": "https://r2...signedUploadUrl.zip"
}


If allowUpload is false or token invalid, backend must return an error; frontend shows:

Upload is not allowed for this job. Please contact your client.

Upload file to R2

The frontend then uploads the selected ZIP to uploadUrl (direct upload to R2).

While upload is in progress:

set status text to:
Status: Upload in progress

optionally disable the upload button to prevent a second attempt.

Notify backend after successful upload

After the R2 upload succeeds, call:

POST /api/editor/jobs/:jobId/upload-complete?t=<token>

Backend should update the job status internally (e.g. UPLOADED / QC_PENDING) and respond with updated job data, including:

{
  "status": "UPLOADED",
  "allowUpload": false
}


Frontend then:

updates status line to: Status: Files uploaded

hides the upload input and button

shows a short message:

Your files have been uploaded successfully. Thank you.

Error handling, messages (all English)

If file type is not .zip:

Only ZIP files are allowed. Please select a .zip file.

If upload fails (network or server error):

Upload failed. Please try again.

If it keeps failing:

If the problem persists, please contact your client.

If no file selected and user clicks upload:

Please select a ZIP file before uploading.

5. Styling

Use the existing design system / Tailwind baseline of the app.

Keep it simple, clean and neutral:

white background, clear typography

no fancy branding notwendig

The most important parts visually:

Job header (code, object name, deadline)

Briefing placeholder box

Download button

Upload section

6. Language constraint

Very important:
All visible text on this Editor Job Page must be English only:

Labels

Buttons

Headings

Status messages

Error messages

No German text or mixed-language strings on this page.
German is only allowed in internal code comments if absolutely necessary, but not in the rendered UI.

7. Future extensibility (just keep in mind)

This V1 implementation must allow us later to replace the placeholder briefing with a structured object (editing styles, clear window, retouch levels, etc.).

For now:

Use the single placeholderNotes field.

Keep the briefing box as one clear section, so we can later add more detail inside it without changing the overall layout.
